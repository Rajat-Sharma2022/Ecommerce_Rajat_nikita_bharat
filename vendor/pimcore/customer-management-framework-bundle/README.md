# Customer Management Framework Bundle for Pimcore

Pimcore allows to manage any kind of data - unstructured, digital assets and structured content. The most obvious 
structured content is product data and all data that is related to products like categories, technologies, brands, etc. 
The built-in E-Commerce-Framework supports with building e-commerce applications and managing transactional data like 
orders.

The third big group of structured data besides products and transaction is customer data. 
The Customer Management Framework (CMF) for Pimcore adds additional functionality  for customer data management, 
segmentation, personalization and marketing automation. So it allows aggregating customer data and user profiles, 
enrich data, link social profiles, build audience segments, trigger events, personalize experience, execute marketing 
automation and much more.

Like Pimcore itself and the E-Commerce-Framework, the CMF is also a Framework for developers to develop customer management
solutions and is tightly integrated into Pimcore core functionality.
